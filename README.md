HostelHub – Hostel Management System

HostelHub is a console-based Hostel Management System developed in C++ to manage hostel operations in an efficient and organized way. The system helps in maintaining student records, room allocations, and fee details, reducing manual work and errors.

The application allows users to add, update, search, and delete student information. It also manages room availability, assigns or changes rooms, and tracks fee status (paid or unpaid). Input validation is implemented to ensure accurate and reliable data handling.

This project demonstrates the use of core C++ programming concepts such as functions, arrays, conditional statements, loops, and basic file handling. HostelHub is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use, making it suitable for small to medium-scale hostel management needs and academic learning purposes.
